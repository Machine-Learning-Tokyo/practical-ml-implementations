# Object Detection
- Object detection plays a crucial role in Computer Vision. Because detecting a particular object is the starting point of many other tasks, for instance;
    - object tracking
    - object recognition/matching (face detection --> face recognition/matching)
    - CBIR - content based image retrieval
- Object detection consists of two main stages:
    - localization
    - classification
