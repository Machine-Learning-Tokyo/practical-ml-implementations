# Object Detection
- Object detection plays a crucial role in Computer Vision. Because detecting a particular object is the starting point of many other tasks, for instance;
    - object tracking
    - object recognition/matching (face detection --> face recognition/matching)
    - CBIR - content based image retrieval

## Brief overview
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/practical-ml-implementations/blob/master/imgs/classification_vs_object_detection.png" width="400"></p>

- Object detection consists of two main stages:
    - localization
    - classification


## Evaluation metrics
- To evaluate the performance of multi class object detection model is:
    - mAP: mean Average Precision

## Face detection from scratch
